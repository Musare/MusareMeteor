License to Musare of Your User-Generated Content.</b> Except as otherwise described in any applicable Additional Terms (such as a contest official rules), which specifically govern the submission of your User-Generated Content, you hereby grant to Musare, the non-exclusive, unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual, and cost-free right and license to use, copy, record, distribute, reproduce, disclose, sell, re-sell, sublicense (through multiple levels), display, publicly perform, transmit, publish, broadcast, translate, make derivative works of, and otherwise use and exploit in any manner whatsoever, all or any portion of your User-Generated Content (and derivative works thereof), for any purpose whatsoever in all formats, on or through any means or medium now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed, and to advertise, market, and promote the same. Without limitation, the granted rights include the right to: (a) configure, host, index, cache, archive, store, digitize, compress, optimize, modify, reformat, edit, adapt, publish in searchable format, and remove such User-Generated Content and combine same with other materials, and (b) use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any User-Generated Content for any purposes whatsoever, including developing, producing, and marketing products and/or services.

In order to further effect the rights and license that you grant to Musare to your User-Generated Content, you also hereby grant to Musare, and agree to grant to Musare, the unconditional, perpetual, irrevocable right to use and exploit your name, persona, and likeness in connection with any User-Generated Content, without any obligation or remuneration to you. Except as prohibited by law, you hereby waive, and you agree to waive, any moral rights (including attribution and integrity) that you may have in any User-Generated Content, even if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you.

        <p><b>D. Exclusive Right to Manage Our Site.</b> Musare may, but will not have any obligation to, review, monitor, display, post, store, maintain, accept, or otherwise make use of, any of your User-Generated Content, and Musare may, in its sole discretion, reject, delete, move, re-format, remove or refuse to post or otherwise make use of User-Generated Content without notice or any liability to you or any third party in connection with our operation of User-Generated Content venues in an appropriate manner. Without limitation, we may do so to address content that comes to our attention that we believe is offensive, obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, violent, harassing, threatening, abusive, illegal or otherwise objectionable or inappropriate, or to enforce the rights of third parties or these Terms or any applicable Additional Terms, including, without limitation, the content restrictions set forth below in Section 6. Such User-Generated Content submitted by you or others need not be maintained on the Site by us for any period of time and you will not have the right, once submitted, to access, archive, maintain, or otherwise use such User-Generated Content on the Site or elsewhere.</p>
        <p><b>E. Representations and Warranties Related to Your User-Generated Content.</b> Each time you submit any User-Generated Content, you represent and warrant that you are at least the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside and are the parent or legal guardian, or have all proper consents from the parent or legal guardian, of any minor who is depicted in or contributed to any User-Generated Content you submit, and that, as to that User-Generated Content, (a) you are the sole author and owner of the intellectual property and other rights to the User-Generated Content, or you have a lawful right to submit the User-Generated Content and grant Musare the rights to it that you are granting by these Terms and any Additional Terms, all without any Musare obligation to obtain consent of any third party and without creating any obligation or liability of Musare; (b) the User-Generated Content is accurate; (c) the User-Generated Content does not and, as to Musare’s permitted uses and exploitation set forth in these Terms, will not infringe any intellectual property or other right of any third party; and (d) the User-Generated Content will not violate these Terms (including the Rules) or any Additional Terms, or cause injury or harm to any person.</p>
        <p><b>F. Enforcement.</b> Musare has no obligation to monitor or enforce your intellectual property rights to your User-Generated Content, but you grant us the right to protect and enforce our rights to your User-Generated Content, including by bringing and controlling actions in your name and on your behalf (at Musare’s cost and expense, to which you hereby consent and irrevocably appoint Musare as your attorney-in-fact, with the power of substitution and delegation, which appointment is coupled with an interest).</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">6. Our Rules</h4>
        <p>We may, but are not obligated to, provide our users with the ability to post and receive messages from other Musare-listed users or allow you to participate in video or live chats with your friends or other users. If we do, you will not use the messaging system or your username to spam, defame, harass, or do anything we find to be objectionable (which is up to us), including, but not limited to, language that attacks or demeans a group based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, veteran status and sexual orientation or gender identity. It is your responsibility to maintain proper etiquette, and we reserve the right to terminate the account for anyone who violates our policies. We also do not monitor any particular chat, but reserve the right to edit, modify, ban, or filter any User-Generated Content or username for any reason. If someone posts something that is offensive or objectionable please let us know and we will do our best to accommodate you. We do not, however, assume any obligation to remove such User-Generated Content.</p>
        <p>You may share videos and music that is hosted on a third party website (i.e., Youtube, Soundcloud, etc.) but only if it does not conflict with their terms or any applicable law. You may not, however, share, post or otherwise communicate any content (video, audio, or text) that is unlawful, threatening, violent, pornographic, harassing, obscene, racist, defamatory, or otherwise objectionable. We reserve the right to determine what is objectionable at our sole discretion.</p>
        <p>In addition to the above, you agree that you will not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>* Infringe on anyone's intellectual property or other legal rights (i.e. invasion of privacy).</li>
            <li>* Hack, crack, phish, SQL inject, or otherwise compromise the security of our website or its servers.</li>
            <li>* Solicit business, spam, or otherwise use our service for commercial purposes unless expressly authorized by us.</li>
            <li>* Defraud or threaten any of our users through any method, whether it be through our website or through another method of communication.</li>
            <li>* Create more than one active user account, or create a new user account if we have previously banned, suspended, or otherwise terminated your first user account.</li>
            <li>* Harass anyone.</li>
            <li>* Impersonate anyone.</li>
            <li>* Do anything unlawful or bad (we define what is bad)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>How we react to your violation of any of these Terms does not mean we will treat everyone the same. We may do anything from giving you a spoken warning, temporarily suspend your account, ban you, or take you to Court.</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">7. Sharing Videos and Music</h4>
        <p>Musare may permit you to share videos and music with your friends. We may also allow you to use video or live chat to discuss the video or music as it is playing. Please note, however, that we do not host any User-Generated Content ourselves. Instead, you must use our platform to share your video or music from the third party video hosting website. You agree that you will be responsible for the User-Generated Content you upload, and that nothing you share will infringe on the rights of anyone. Furthermore, you warrant you have the ability to grant the right to share such User-Generated Content without any obligation to pay any royalties to any copyright owner. You will be responsible for the payment of any royalty and any associated damages, fees, fines or penalties, in the event we find out you have shared User-Generated Content in violation of another’s intellectual property rights.</p>
        <p>Not to sound like a broken record, but we have to make sure you understand that you will be responsible for any User-Generated Content that you upload, including the consequences of any infringement. By sharing any User-Generated Content you are, in essence, utilizing a third party license to distribute and share User-Generated Content. You may only do this if the Site from which you are linking has given you a license to share such User-Generated Content in the manner contemplated. If it does not, then you cannot share that User-Generated Content.</p>
        <p>For further clarity, you must only distribute videos or music that you are legally permitted to...meaning you cannot share videos or music that violates anyone’s third party intellectual property rights. For example, you must not share anything that the third party site would prohibit. In addition you will not modify, edit, disassemble, or create derivatives of anything that you do not own the rights to.</p>
        <p>Should you believe that your rights are being infringed on by, please note that we are not responsible for hosting it and it is the third party site which is serving the file, and until is removed from the third party site, it will still be available through their search engine. As such, copyright notices should be sent to both us and the third party site, and you should visit their terms for more information.</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">8. DMCA Notices</h4>

        <h4 class="center-align">9. Points and Virtual Currency</h4>
        <p>The Site may include virtual, in-game currency (“Virtual Currency”), such as credits, coins, ranks (“Name Tags”), XP, cash, or points (e.g., Experience Points), that may be purchased with “real world” money or obtained through spending time on the Site or otherwise interacting with a third-party service. Virtual Currency may be used to purchase virtual, in-game digital items (“Virtual Goods”). Your purchase or award of Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods are merely a grant by us to a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-assignable, personal, and non-transferable right to use the Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods as part of the Site under these Terms and any applicable Additional Terms we provide at the time. Accordingly, you have no property, proprietary, intellectual property, ownership, or monetary interest in your Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods, which remain our Content and property. The right may be immediately suspended or terminated for any reason, in our sole discretion, and without advance notice or liability. We reserve the absolute right, at any time and in our sole discretion, to manage, regulate, control, modify or eliminate Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods.</p>
        <p>Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods cannot be redeemed by you for “real world” money, goods, or other items of monetary value from any party. Transfers of Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods by you outside of what we permit on the Site are strictly prohibited. This means you may not buy or sell Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods for “real world” money or otherwise exchange items for value outside of the Site. Any such attempted transfer will be null and void.</p>
        <p>You also agree that all sales of Virtual Currency and Virtual Goods are final unless otherwise detailed in the applicable Additional Terms. No refunds will be given by us. You agree that you will be solely responsible for paying any applicable taxes related to the acquisition of, use of or access to Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods.</p>
        <p>We have the absolute right, but not the obligation, to manage, regulate, control, modify, delete, alter, move, remove, transfer and/or eliminate Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods, in whole or in part, as we see fit, at any time in our sole discretion, including the right to terminate or suspend your account or discontinue the Site (in whole or in part) for any reason, and we shall have no liability to you or anyone for the exercise of such rights. If we suspend or terminate any Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods, then you will forfeit the suspended or terminated subscription or items, except as may be set forth in any Additional Terms (such as any refund policies that may apply to the Site). Likewise, except as may be set forth in any Additional Terms or as required by applicable law, we are not responsible for repairing or replacing same, or providing you any credit or refund or any other sum, in the event of our modification of any Virtual Currency or Virtual Goods, or for loss or damage due to error, or any other reason.</p>
        <p>As we feel necessary, in our sole and absolute discretion, we may limit the total amount of Virtual Currency that may be purchased at any one time, and/or limit the total Virtual Currency that may be held in your account in the aggregate. Additionally, price and availability of certain types of Virtual Currency and/or Virtual Goods are subject to change without notice. You are solely responsible for verifying that the proper amount of Virtual Currency has been added to or deducted from your account during any given transaction, so please notify us immediately should you believe that a mistake has been made with respect to your Virtual Currency balance. If we choose, in our discretion, to investigate your claim, in doing so, may request some additional information and/or documentation to verify your claim. We will let you know the results of any investigation, however, you acknowledge and agree that we have the sole and absolute discretion in determining whether or not your claim is valid, and if so, the appropriate remedy.</p>
        <p>NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU SHALL HAVE NO OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN YOUR ACCOUNT, AND YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ALL RIGHTS IN AND TO THE ACCOUNT ARE AND SHALL FOREVER BE OWNED BY AND INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF MUSARE. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO CLAIM, RIGHT, TITLE, OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPRIETARY INTEREST IN THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY, VIRTUAL GOODS OR THAT YOU ACQUIRE, REGARDLESS OF THE CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR VIRTUAL CURRENCY OR VIRTUAL ITEMS. FURTHERMORE, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR THE DESTRUCTION, DELETION, MODIFICATION, IMPAIRMENT, “HACKING,” OR ANY OTHER DAMAGE OR LOSS OF ANY KIND CAUSED TO THE VIRTUAL CURRENCY, VIRTUAL GOODS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE DELETION OF THEREOF UPON THE TERMINATION, ABANDONMENT OR EXPIRATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT.</p>

First – Try To Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes.</b> If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Site, the Content, your User-Generated Content, these Terms, or any Additional Terms, whether heretofore or hereafter arising (collectively, “Dispute”), or to any of Musare’s actual or alleged intellectual property rights (an “Excluded Dispute”, which includes those actions set forth in Section 14.D), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. But if no such information exists or if such information is not current, then we have no obligation under this Section 14.A. Your notice to us must be sent to: Musare, Inc., 5900 Wilshire Blvd, 21st Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90036 (Attn: Legal Department). For a period of sixty (60) days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Musare and you will engage in a dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute, though nothing will require either you or Musare to resolve the Dispute or Excluded Dispute on terms with respect to which you and Musare, in each of our sole discretion, are not comfortable.</p>
        <p><b>B. Forums For Alternative Dispute Resolution.</b></p>
            <p><b>(i) Arbitration.</b> If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 14.A within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration in accordance with this Section 14.B. If we cannot resolve an Excluded Dispute as set forth in Section 14.A within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Excluded Dispute to formal arbitration only if you and Musare consent, in a writing signed by you and an officer or legal representative of Musare, to have that Excluded Dispute subject to arbitration. In such a case, (and only in such a case), that Excluded Dispute will be deemed a “Dispute” for the remainder of this Section 14.B.</p>
            <p>Upon expiration of the applicable sixty-day period and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than fifteen (15) years’ experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $250,000, or if Musare elects, in its sole discretion, to bear the costs of arbitration in excess of those that would occur for a proceeding before a single neutral arbitrator, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three-member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will be chair of the panel) selected by the two party-appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award. If you and Musare do not both consent to the arbitration of an Excluded Dispute as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Section 14.B(i), then this paragraph and the remainder of this Section 14.B will not apply to the Excluded Dispute.</p>
            <p>If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a “demand for arbitration,” then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. (“JAMS”) using JAMS’ streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration Site that you and an officer or legal representative of Musare consent to in writing. The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $250,000 threshold for a the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above for the AAA arbitration will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or another arbitration Site.</p>
            <p>You can obtain AAA and JAMS procedures, rules, and fee information as follows:</p>
            <p>
                AAA: 800.778.7879 http://www.adr.org <br />
                JAMS: 949.224.1810 http://www.jamsadr.com</p>
            <p><b>(ii) Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution.</b> In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of these Terms (and any Additional Terms) and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys’ fees). However, WITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED. All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the “metropolitan statistical area” (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Musare to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 14 to be enforceable, then Musare will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration, or to decline to do so and have the matter resolved through the courts. Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. The arbitrator’s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based. Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
        <p><b>C. Limited Time To File Claims.</b> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE (BUT NOT AN EXCLUDED DISPUTE) AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH IN SECTION 14.A) WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES – OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.</p>
        <p><b>D. Injunctive Relief.</b> The foregoing provisions of this Section 14 will not apply to any legal action taken by Musare to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Site, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or Musare’s intellectual property rights (including such Musare may claim that may be in dispute), Musare’s operations, and/or Musare’s products or services.</p>
        <p><b>E. Small Claims Matters Are Excluded From Arbitration Requirement.</b> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring qualifying claim of Disputes (but not Excluded Disputes) in small claims court, subject to Section 14.G.</p>
        <p><b>F. No Class Action Matters.</b> Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitration or other proceedings that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to Section 14.B(i) holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 14.B to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court pursuant to Section 14.G.</p>
        <p><b>G. Federal and State Courts in Los Angeles.</b> Except to the extent that arbitration is required in Section 14.B, and except as to the enforcement of any arbitration decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute may only be instituted in state or federal court in Los Angeles County, California. Accordingly, you and Musare consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">15. Waiver of Injunctive or Other Equitable Relief</h4>
        <p>IF YOU CLAIM THAT YOU HAVE INCURRED ANY LOSS, DAMAGES, OR INJURIES IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SITE, THEN THE LOSSES, DAMAGES, AND INJURIES WILL NOT BE IRREPARABLE OR SUFFICIENT TO ENTITLE YOU TO AN INJUNCTION OR TO OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF OF ANY KIND. THIS MEANS THAT, IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR CLAIM, YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL NOT SEEK, AND THAT YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO OBTAIN, ANY COURT OR OTHER ACTION THAT MAY INTERFERE WITH OR PREVENT THE DEVELOPMENT OR EXPLOITATION OF ANY WEBSITE, APPLICATION, CONTENT, USER-GENERATED CONTENT, PRODUCT, SITE, OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNED, LICENSED, USED OR CONTROLLED BY MUSARE (INCLUDING YOUR LICENSED USER-GENERATED CONTENT) OR A LICENSOR OF MUSARE.</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">16. Force Majeure</h4>
        <p>You agree that we are not responsible to you for anything that we may otherwise be responsible for, if it is the result of events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, war, insurrection, riots, terrorism, crime, labor shortages (including lawful and unlawful strikes), any third party site being down, communication disruption, failure or shortage of infrastructure, zombie attacks, shortage of materials, or any other event beyond our control.</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">17. Cancellation of Service</h4>
        <p>You agree that we may cancel our service or the Site at any time, for any reason, without warning or compensation, even if we have been advised that it may result in a loss to you or any other party.</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">18. Severability</h4>
        <p>In the event that a provision of this Agreement is found to be unlawful or otherwise unenforceable, the Agreement will remain in force as though it had been entered into without that unlawful or unenforceable provision being included in it.</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">19. Update to Terms</h4>
        <p>These Terms (or if applicable Additional Terms), in the form posted at the time of your use of the Site to which it applies, shall govern such use (including transactions entered during such use). AS OUR SITE EVOLVES, THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH WE OFFER THE SITE MAY PROSPECTIVELY BE MODIFIED AND WE MAY CEASE OFFERING THE SITE UNDER THE TERMS OR ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR WHICH THEY WERE PREVIOUSLY OFFERED. ACCORDINGLY, EACH TIME YOU SIGN IN TO OR OTHERWISE USE THE SITE YOU ARE ENTERING INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH US ON THE THEN APPLICABLE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF OTHER TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SITE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE SITE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS. Therefore, you should review the posted terms of Site and any applicable Additional Terms each time you use the Site (at least prior to each transaction or submission). The Additional Terms will be effective as to new use and transactions as of the time that we post them, or such later date as may be specified in them or in other notice to you. However, the Terms (and any applicable Additional Terms) that applied when you previously used the Site will continue to apply to such prior use (i.e., changes and additions are prospective only) unless mutually agreed. In the event any notice to you of new, revised or additional terms is determined by a tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs. You should frequently check the home page, your message account and the e-mail you associated with your account for notices, all of which you agree are reasonable manners of providing you notice. You can reject any new, revised or Additional Terms by discontinuing use of the Site and related services.</p>

        <h4 class="center-align">20. Investigations; Cooperation with Law Enforcement; Termination; Survival</h4>
        <p>Musare reserves the right, without any limitation, to: (i) investigate any suspected breaches of its Site security or its information technology or other systems or networks, (ii) investigate any suspected breaches of these Terms and any Additional Terms, (iii) investigate any information obtained by Musare in connection with reviewing law enforcement databases or complying with criminal laws, (iv) involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in investigating any of the foregoing matters, (v) prosecute violators of these Terms and any Additional Terms, and (vi) discontinue the Site, in whole or in part, or, except as may be expressly set forth in any Additional Terms, suspend or terminate your access to it, in whole or in part, including any user accounts or registrations, at any time, without notice, for any reason and without any obligation to you or any third party. Any suspension or termination will not affect your obligations to Musare under these Terms or any Additional Terms. Upon suspension or termination of your access to the Site, or upon notice from Musare, all rights granted to you under these Terms or any Additional Terms will cease immediately, and you agree that you will immediately discontinue use of the Site. The provisions of these Terms and any Additional Terms, which by their nature should survive your suspension or termination will survive, including the rights and licenses you grant to Musare in these Terms, as well as the indemnities, releases, disclaimers, and limitations on liability and the provisions regarding jurisdiction, choice of law, no class action, and mandatory arbitration.</p>
