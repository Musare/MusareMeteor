            MusicApp reserves the right to update and change the Terms of Service from time to time without notice. Any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new tools and resources, shall be subject to the Terms of Service.

            Violation of any of the terms below will result in the termination of your Account. While MusicApp prohibits such conduct and Content on the Service, you understand and agree that MusicApp cannot be responsible for the Content posted on the Service and you nonetheless may be exposed to such materials. You agree to use the Service at your own risk.
